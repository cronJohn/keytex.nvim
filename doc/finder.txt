This module provides functions for finding and exploring keybindings using Telescope

                                             *finder.keybinding_picker()*
keybinding_picker({filter}, {opts})
    Opens a Telescope window and filters using *key* by default. Upon selecting
    a Telescope entry, you will be taken to the exact file and line number
    of where that keybinding was created using keytex. Examples: >lua

        local finder = require('keytex.finder')

        -- Filter by mode
        finder.keybinding_picker('mode')

        -- Filter by description
        finder.keybinding_picker('description')
<

    Parameters:  
      • {filter}    (string) The initial filtering method. It can be one of the following:
        - `mode`: Filters by the mode the keybinding is in (e.g., *n*ormal, *v*isual, *i*nsert).
        - `key`: Filters by the key combination.
        - `action`: Filters by what the keybinding maps to.
        - `description`: Filters by the description of the keybinding.
        - `source`: Filters by the file where the keybinding is defined.
        - `line`: Filters by the line number where the keybinding is located.
      • {opts}      (table) Optional table of configuration options for Telescope.
